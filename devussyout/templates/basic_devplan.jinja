You are an expert project manager and software architect. You have been given a project design document and need to create a high-level development plan that breaks the project into logical phases.

{% if task_grouping == 'grouped' %}
## Task Grouping Mode: PARALLEL SWARM EXECUTION

This devplan will be used by Ralph Swarm for parallel execution. You must organize tasks into **groups** that can run in parallel without file conflicts.

**Grouping Requirements:**
1. **Divide each phase into 2-4 task groups** that can run in parallel
2. **Minimize file overlap** between groups in the same phase
3. **Provide estimated file patterns** for each group using glob syntax
4. **Keep group size reasonable**: 3-7 tasks per group
5. **Group related tasks**: tasks touching the same files should be in the same group

**Group Format:**
```
- **Group 1** [estimated_files: src/auth/*, tests/auth/*]
  - Create authentication module
  - Add login endpoint
  - Implement session handling
```

{% endif %}

{% if repo_context %}
{{ shared.section_repo_context(repo_context, detail_level='verbose') }}

**Important:** Your devplan should respect the existing project structure, follow detected patterns, and integrate smoothly with the current codebase.

{% if code_samples %}

### 📝 Code Samples from Repository

The following code samples illustrate the existing architecture, patterns, and conventions:

{{ code_samples }}

**Use these samples to:**
- Understand the current code style and conventions
- Identify existing patterns to follow
- See how similar features are implemented
- Ensure consistency with the existing codebase

{% if interactive_session %}
## 🎯 Interactive Session Context

This project was defined through an interactive guided questionnaire. The user provided responses to targeted questions about their requirements, technology preferences, and project goals. This context should inform your development plan to ensure it aligns with their stated needs and experience level.

**Session Details:**
- Questions asked: {{ interactive_session.question_count if interactive_session.question_count else "Multiple" }}
- Project approach: Interactive, user-guided design
{% endif %}

### Complexity Assessment
- **Rating**: {{ project_design.complexity }}
- **Estimated Phases**: {{ project_design.estimated_phases }}
{% endif %}

## Your Task

Create a high-level development plan that organizes the project implementation into **{{ project_design.estimated_phases if project_design.estimated_phases else "5-10" }} logical phases**. Each phase should represent a major milestone or functional area of the project.

### Requirements

1. **Phase Structure**: Each phase should have:
   - A clear, descriptive title
   - A brief summary of what will be accomplished
   - 3-7 major components or work items

2. **Logical Ordering**: Phases should be ordered such that:
   - Dependencies are respected (foundational work comes first)
   - Each phase builds on previous phases
   - The project can be developed incrementally

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The phases should cover:
   - Project initialization and setup
   - Interactive features (if building an interactive application)
   - Core functionality implementation
   - Testing and quality assurance
   - Documentation
   - Deployment and distribution (if applicable)

4. **Scope**: Phases may vary in scope as needed—do not artificially balance their sizes. Prefer completeness and clarity over uniformity.

{% if task_grouping == 'grouped' %}
5. **Task Grouping** (CRITICAL for parallel swarm execution):
   - Within each phase, create 2-4 task groups
   - Each group contains 3-7 related tasks
   - Groups should have minimal file overlap
   - Specify estimated file patterns for each group using glob syntax
   - Format: `- **Group N** [estimated_files: pattern1/*, pattern2/*]`
{% else %}
5. **User Experience**: If the project involves user interaction (CLI, web, mobile), ensure phases include:
   - Interactive UI/UX design and implementation
   - User input validation and error handling
   - Help text, examples, and guidance for users
   - Session management (if applicable)

### Example Structure for GROUPED MODE (DO NOT COPY - adapt to the specific project)

```
Phase 1: Project Initialization

- **Group 1** [estimated_files: package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore, .eslintrc.js]
  - Set up version control repository
  - Configure development environment
  - Install dependencies and tools
  - Set up linting and formatting

- **Group 2** [estimated_files: src/*, tests/setup/*]
  - Create basic project structure
  - Set up test framework
  - Create base application skeleton

Phase 2: Core Data Models

- **Group 1** [estimated_files: src/models/*, src/db/migrations/*]
  - Define data schemas
  - Create database migration files
  - Implement data validation

- **Group 2** [estimated_files: src/repositories/*, tests/unit/models/*]
  - Build data access layer
  - Create repository tests
  - Add data factory utilities

Phase 3: Business Logic

- **Group 1** [estimated_files: src/services/*, src/utils/*]
  - Implement core algorithms
  - Build service layer
  - Create utility functions

- **Group 2** [estimated_files: src/middleware/*, src/errors/*]
  - Add error handling
  - Create middleware components
  - Implement logging

... (continue with additional phases as needed)
```

## Output Format

{% if task_grouping == 'grouped' %}
Please structure your response as a numbered list of phases with task groups. For each phase:

1. Start with "**Phase N: [Phase Title]**"
2. Add a brief description (1-2 sentences)
3. Divide the phase into 2-4 task groups:
   - Start each group with "- **Group N** [estimated_files: pattern1/*, pattern2/*]"
   - List 3-7 tasks as indented bullet points under each group
   - Ensure groups have minimal file overlap
4. Keep descriptions clear and actionable

Focus on creating a roadmap optimized for parallel execution by swarm workers.
